          <strong>Adobe Dreamweaver</strong> is a proprietary web development tool from Adobe Inc.. It was created by Macromedia in 1997[1] and developed by them until Macromedia was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2005. <br><br>
          Adobe Dreamweaver is available for the macOS and Windows operating systems. <br><br>Following Adobe's acquisition of the Macromedia product suite, releases of Dreamweaver subsequent to version 8.0 have been more compliant with W3C standards. Recent versions have improved support for Web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting languages and frameworks including ASP (ASP JavaScript, ASP VBScript, ASP.NET C#, ASP.NET VB), ColdFusion, Scriptlet, and PHP.
          <p>Features</p>
          Adobe Dreamweaver CC is a web design and development application that uses both a visual design surface known as Live View and a code editor with standard features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and code collapsing as well as more advanced features such as real-time syntax checking and code introspection for generating code hints to assist the user in writing code. Combined with an array of site management tools, Dreamweaver allows for its users design, code and manage websites, as well as mobile content. Dreamweaver is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool. You can live preview of changes for the frontend. Dreamweaver is positioned as a versatile web design and development tool that enables visualization of web content while coding. <br><br>Dreamweaver, like other HTML editors, edits files locally then uploads them to the remote web server using FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV. Dreamweaver CS4 now supports the Subversion (SVN) version control system.
          <br><br>Since version 5, Dreamweaver supports syntax highlighting for the following languages out of the box:
          <ul>
            <li>ActionScript</li>
            <li>Active Server Pages (ASP).</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
            <li>ColdFusion</li>
            <li>EDML</li>
            <li>Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)</li>
            <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
            <li>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)</li>
            <li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Visual Basic (VB)</li>
            <li>Visual Basic Script Edition (VBScript)</li>
            <li>Wireless Markup Language (WML)</li>
          </ul>
          Support for Active Server Pages (ASP) and JavaServer Pages was dropped in version CS5.<br><br>Users can add their own language syntax highlighting. In addition, code completion is available for many of these languages.
